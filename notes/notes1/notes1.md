# Week 1 Notes

## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a *markup* (no, seriously) language which is used to format otherwise boring old text with special characters. It is extremely easy to use, versatile, and consistent across platforms. Markdown is widely used among developers, *especially* in Github for documentation.  

## What is Linux?

**Linux** is an open-source operating system created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Linux is a versatile OS in that it can be run on many different types of hardware, including older machines. Linux is considered to be *extremely* secure, which is why companies like Amazon, Google, and Netflix all use it for their services.

## What is Ubuntu?

**Ubuntu** is a free, open-source operating system based on Debian Linux. Ubuntu is developed by Canonical and a community of other developers. Similar to Linux, Ubuntu is designed to be secure, with regular updates and built-in security features. Ubuntu uses Linux Desktop environments, like GNOME, to make navigation easier. Ubuntu is used in data centers and cloud environments across the world.
