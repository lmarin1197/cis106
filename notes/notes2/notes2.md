# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes 

### 1. What is an Operating System?
An **operating system** is what provides all fundamental software features of a computer. An **OS** enables you to use the computer's hardware, providing you the basic tools that make the  computer useful.

### 2. What is a kernel?
An **OS kernel** is a software component that's responsible for managing low-level features of the computer, including the following managing system hardware:
- Memory allocation
- CPU time
- Program to program interaction

### 3. Which other parts aside from the kernel identify an OS?
- Command-Line shells
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
- Utility and productivity programs
- Libraries

### 4. What is linux and linux distribution?
**Linux** is a **Unix-Like operating system** popular in academic and business environments. It consists of a kernel, libraries, and utilities that make up the entire operating system. A **Linux distribution** is any OS that runs on the Linux kernel. 

### 6. List at least 4 linux characteristics:
- Linux is **open source software**
- Available for **FREE**
- **Highly scalable** and customizable
- Majority of **server applications** on the internet run on some version of Linux
- 
### 7. What is Ubuntu?
**Ubuntu** is a **Linux distribution**, freely available with both community and professional support.

### 8. What is Debian?
**Debian** is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to developing free software. It is known to be the Grandfather of all linux distributions alongside **Slackware** and **Open Suse**

### 9. List and define the different types of licensing agreements
- **Open Source:** The software may be distributed for a fee or free. The source code is distributed with the software.
- **Closed Source:** The software is not distributed with the source code. The user is restricted from modifying the code.
    - **Freeware:** The software is free but the source code isn't available.
    - **Shareware:** The software is free on a trial basis.
- **Free software:** The software is distributed with the source code. The software can be free of charge or obtained by a fee. 

### 10. What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.
The **Free Software Foundation (FSF)**, is a critical force in the open source world. It is the driving force behind the ***GNU*** **project**.
The four freedoms are as follows:
1. **Freedom 0:** use the software for any purpose
2. **Freedom 1:** examine the source code and modify it as you see fit
3. **Freedom 2:** redistribute the software
4. **Freedom 3:** redistribute your modified software

### 11. What is virtualization?
**Virtualization** is defined as creating virtual versions of something. It is often used to let multiple **OSs** run on the physical machine at the same time.
